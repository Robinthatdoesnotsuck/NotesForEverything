# AWS Basics

## Fundamentals of AWS

+ Almost all moder computing centers around the basic client-server model.
	+ The client makes a request that the server receives and responds to it
		+ The client is a web browser or an app that a person is using
	+ In amazon usually the servers is:
		+ An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud or EC2 instance
	+ EC2
		+ It is just a virtual server 
+ You only pay for what you use
	+ What happens usually in on-premise data centers is that you have a lot of servers and 
	infraestructure on iddle
	+ So on AWS they solve this by being a pay while use so that you have the amount of services or 
	infrastructure needed by the time you use it

+ Cloud computing is the on-deman delivery of IT resources over the interner
	+ Pay-as-you-go pricing
		+ On-demand delovery
		+ The resources you need by the time you use them
