# A flask webservices
+ All communications between everything in the internet is sent by text
  + So we use json, XML, HTML, etc. to send data even images or videos 
    + This happens because we use TCP protocol 
    + But the most used format is JSON
      - Jsons are like dictionaries in python
  
## Requests get and post
+ A request is a call to the server
  + A call is a message that we send to a server as a client and we get a response to this message or petition for an specific resource
    + The petition is asking to gives us a resource that can be a page, text, data, etc
+ The server accepts the request if its valid or it was configured on the server programming
  + So a server doesn't just receive everything its sent at
  + If the server gets a valid request it' sends back a response
    + This response it's the resource and the status code of the request
