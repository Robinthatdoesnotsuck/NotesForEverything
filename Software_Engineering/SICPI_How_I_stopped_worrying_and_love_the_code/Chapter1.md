# The start of structuring and interpreting computer programs

## Notes from the book and useful know-how

+ How we need to start thinking procedurally instead of just the output or the input of data.

+ Evaluation rules
  + Combinations
    + The first step of an evaluation process for a combination we must first perform an evaluation process on each element.
    + This means that the evaluation is recursive in nature.
  + Especial forms
    + They are the exception of not making a combination either with an operator of n or more number of arguments that have already an associated value on them.

+ Tree accumulation
  + A way to see how a procedure or the implementation of one "percolate values upward" this means that it filters upwards up to the final value that we want.

+ Stuff that we need in any powerful language
  + Number and arithmetic data and procedures as primitives
  + Nesting of combinations to combine operation
  + A primitive way of abstraction
