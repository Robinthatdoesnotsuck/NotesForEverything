# The need to test stuff in software engineering

## Unit Testing

- Testing helps us, well test our programs in a safe manner and helps in having healthy code in our development life cycle
- Also helps in achieving more modular and decoupled code, cause as we test things in our code we need to have isolated functionality to achieve good testing functions
- Also helps in Refactoring code, helping in the design of better code and self documentation
